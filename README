## Preface ##
This is a project of mine I never actually used git for in the first place when
initially making it. In fact, I actually forgot about the existence of this GitHub account 
of mine until very recently!. However, I had stored each "version" of the script in separate
files, meaning that I could commit each file individually to this fresh repository, as a way
to preserve some semblance of history and of my coding process.

This was an entry to a programming contest, and I ended up not only getting an A, but also
earning 3rd place in the "Games & Puzzles" category. I was also required to make a video about 
this project, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK_qsTExHZY

This is best played with the Spyder IDE. I might come back to this in the future and use a 
more conventional library for this type of project, but that's still very much up in the air :)

## Original README ##
SPYANSWER! is a trivia game played within the Spyder IDE. The game itself is modeled after
the Jeopardy! game show and takes many cues from it, although you do not have to strictly
follow that game's format. The game is played with 3 players in 2 rounds - each round has
6 categories of 5 questions each with increasing point values, and the 2nd round's point
values are doubled compared to the first round. The winner is simply the player with the
most points at the end of the game. If you wish, you can make your own categories with
their own questions and answers by editing the provided categories1.json and categories2.json
files (whilst keeping the format intact, otherwise the file cannot be used).

INCLUDED FILES:
    spyanswer.py     - The program itself
    categories1.json - Categories, questions and answers for the first round of the game
    categories2.json - Categories, questions and answers for the second round of the game
    README           - The file you're reading right now.

HOW TO PLAY:
    - Run the file.
    - Type 1 and press ENTER.
    - Follow the prompts to set players up.
    - When asked to pick a category, type in a number from 1 to 6 (corresponding to the position
      of the category on the plot).
    - When asked to pick a wager, select one of the available point amounts under the selected
      category.
    - The plot will then display a question. Wait three seconds, then press the key associated
      with your player (A, B or L for players 1, 2 and 3 respectively) and press ENTER
        - If you buzzed in succesfully, answer the question!
            - If you answer the question wrong, you lose points and the other players get a
              chance to answer.
            - If you answer the question right, you gain points and the game goes on.
        - If nobody buzzes in and you press ENTER, the game continues and no one earns any
          points for the question
    - Repeat until the game ends!
    - If you wish to end a round prematurely, type "end" at the category prompt.
